                        A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
                        relates the key and values.

                            operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
                            Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

                          description: |-
                            values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
                            the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
                            the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
                            merge patch.

                      matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
                      map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                      operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
